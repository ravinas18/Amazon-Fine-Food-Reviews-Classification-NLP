# Amazon-Fine-Food-Reviews-Classification-NLP
## Abstract
The project aimed at building best working model for classification of positive and negative reviews.
Apply Logistic Regression algorithm using each technique.

## Dataset 
The dataset used is https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews.
This dataset consists of reviews of fine foods from amazon. The data span a period of more than 10 years, including all ~500,000                reviews up to October 2012. Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plain text review. It also includes reviews            from all other Amazon categories.

## Procedure to execute classification is as follows:
_Step1_: Data Pre-processing is applied on given amazon reviews data-set.And Take sample of data from dataset because of computational limitations.
_Step2_: Time based splitting on train and test datasets.
_Step3_: Apply Feature generation techniques(Bow,tfidf).
_Step4_: Apply Logistic Regression algorithm using each technique.
_Step5_: To find lambda using gridsearch cross-validation and random cross-validation.
_Step5_: L2 regularization.
